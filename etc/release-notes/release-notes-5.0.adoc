Released: TODO

== Enhancements
* The functions classes F, F2, F0, Effect1 and Effect2 extend the corresponding Java 8 function interface.  Removed the corresponding classes F1W, F1Functions, F2W and F2Functions.  Similarly for IO and IOW.
* Moved the function wrapper classes F1W and F2W into F and F2 as default functions.
* Added lifting a semigroup to an option monoid, using none as zero.
* Added Trampoline.suspend(F0<Trampoline<A>>)
* Added sum, product and fromString to Longs.
* Added Bounded definition.
* Added toStream of Bounded in Enumerator.
* Added intersection monoid for sets.
* Added set intersection semigroup.
* Added FunctionalInterface annotations for interfaces F0, F, F2 to F8, IO and SafeIO.
* Added functions to IO.
* Added Either3.
* Updated IO and SafeIO inheritance.
* Added conversion functions for Effect, F, Try and TryEffect for low arities.

== Fixes
* Fixed BitSet properties test.

== Internal
* Upgraded to Gradle 6.8.3.
* Added Strategy, Validation, Integers, monoid, semigroup and monoid tests.
* Switch from the uptodate-gradle-plugin to gradle-versions-plugin.
* Speed up Gradle tests by running in parallel and not generating reports.

== Breaking Changes
* Removed Ord parameter from Monoid's setIntersectionMonoid function.
* Removed the classes F1W, F1Functions, F2W, F2Functions, F3W, F3Functions, F4W, F4Functions, F5W, F5Functions, F6W, F6Functions, F7W, F7Functions, F8W and F8Functions.
* Removed deprecated Monoid, Ord, P, P1, Semigroup, Array, HashMap, Java, List, Seq, Set, Stream, Gen, Rand and TreeMap functions.

== Documentation
* Fixed the javadoc on Either's iif function.
* Fixed doc for union and intersection monoid for sets.
* Fixed semigroup docs.
* Fixed List.headOption.
